I am an Applied Scientist at [WGames](https://wgames.com/), currently focused on recommendation system, reinforcement learning, and generative adversarial network. In the meantime, I am also an Artificial Intelligence Researcher at [Leafy.ai](https://leafy.ai/) working on natural language processing. Previously, I worked in a start-up company, [Istuary Innovation Group](http://google.com/), on developing deep learning algorithms on smart camera, which includes face recognition, face alignment, and object recognition. I'm interested in transfer learning, multi-task learning, and light neural network models for NLP and democratizing machine learning and AI. Have a look at my [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12JC-CSasaQpasyAhzh2llL2ZI5FlCFX-/view?usp=sharing) for more information.

I write this blog not only to help me refresh my memory about engineering details and theory behind models, training tricks, and optimization but also to communicate with people who might read and share what they know so we can learn from each other.
